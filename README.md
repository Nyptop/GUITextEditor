Building a GUI text editor with two designs. One has a Text class that is 'specialised' to the user interface. The other has a more 'general purpose' text class. Inspiration comes from Chapter 6 of John Ousterhout's book 'A Philosophy of Software Design'.

Three guiding questions to achieve a good, general purpose design:

1. What is the simplest interface that will cover all my current needs?
2. In how many situations will this method be used?
3. Is this API easy to use for my current needs?

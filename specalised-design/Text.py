# this is the design you're more likely to implement - knowing about the GUI class where
# you need to implement, natural to design text class with the GUI in mind. 

# for specialised design, we want to have the cursor as its own separate class
# passing cursor as an argument to delete? Or actually, having cursor attribute and
# methods is just as bad?

# this design is a lot longer than for general purpose, but with what benefit? 
# the interface within the class (all the methods) is great here, and there are
#Â a lot more methods, but it doesn't make life that much easier for the caller
# and crucially, this class is more difficult to understand. 

# important way to think about cognitive load: our goal is to reduce the complexity 
# of the system as a whole. That means here, and with the caller. In the specialised
# design, we are decreasing complexity (only slightly) for the caller, and we are 
# increasing it substantially here. Better to increase complexity slightly for the 
# caller, but to make it substantially simpler here. 

# on change, less information leakage, design decisions contained to one place (this adds up over time).
# Also, if you wish to use the class for another purpose you can (not the main reason, 
# not as common a benefit but still worth mentioning).
# example of a change: creating a new interface operation (like space), in specialised design
# means we need to define a new method. In general purpose design, we could just use insert method.
